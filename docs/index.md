# Start

This is the manual, for the [Github repository Containers 101](https://github.com/rhjensen79/containers101)

## Getting Started

To get started, using the training, you first need to login to your Github account, and open this [repository](https://github.com/rhjensen79/containers101)

To get your own copy, you need to fork it.
Forking means, that you take a copy, of the repo, and save it under your own name.
This means that all changes, are your own, and does not affect the "original" repository.

- Start by pressing the Fork button, in the top right corner, in the repository.
